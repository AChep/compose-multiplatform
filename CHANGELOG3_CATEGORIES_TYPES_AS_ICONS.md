_Changes since 1.5.12_

_🔥 highlighted feature, ⚠️ breaking change, ⚙️ feature, 🔧 fix_

## Common

- 🔥 Resource library improvements ([an example project](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/8ee7531c424421657842a24a5c365db53ba19e18/components/resources/demo))
  - [Compile-time checking of resources through a generated `Res` class](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/pull/3961)
  - [Introduce top level `composeResources` dir with `drawable`, `font`, `files`, `values/strings.xml` support](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/pull/4127)
  - [Support for various screen densities, multiple languages and regions, and light and dark themes](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/pull/4018)

- 🔥 [Support Kotlin 2.0.0-Beta4](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/pull/4332)
- ⚠️ Resource library (`compose.components.resources`) changes
  - resources from `*Main\resources` should be moved to `*Main\composeResources\drawable`, `commonMain\composeResources\font` or `*Main\composeResources\files` depending on the resource type
  - `painterResource("resource.xml")` should be replaced by `painterResource(Res.drawable.resource)`
- ⚠️ `google()` maven repository is now required. Add this to `build.gradle.kts`:
  ```
  repositories {
      ...
      google()
  }
  ```
  If the project doesn't have it, there will be an error `Could not find androidx.annotation:annotation:...` or `Could not find org.jetbrains.compose.collection-internal:collection`.
